In order to build this locally, you may need to tweak the output directory of tactsuit_vr_plugin.
You will need to manually copy the owo folder into SKSE\Plugins\

See the release for example of how the files should look (it's the same as Shizof's bHaptics, but instead of bHaptics folder there is an OWO folder)
